# Cifar10_CNN_Project
---

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project is developed in Python using TensorFlow/Keras and demonstrates core deep learning practices including model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of performance metrics. The model is trained to recognize 10 different object classes such as airplanes, cars, and animals. This project serves as a foundational exploration of CNNs in computer vision and can be extended for more complex classification tasks.
